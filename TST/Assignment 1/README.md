# Assignment 1

## Part 1 - Reflections

### 1.1 - Shooting
> _A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die.  
> List the possible reasons for the man not dying._

1. The gun did not discharge (fire) properly.
2. The bullet did not hit the man.
4. The bullet hit the man, but the shot was not fatal.
5. The bullet hit the man, but the man wore protective gear.
6. The bullet hit the man, and he would have died, if it weren't for an intervention.
7. The man was invincible
8. Something was not real
9. Nothing was real

Or any combination of the above.


### 1.2 - Alien
> _An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the
alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-by-
step instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can. (Example: Hold the
toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap
anti-clockwise)_

Assume location is bathroom and you are infront of the bathroom sink. The bathroom light is on. The toothpaste is not empty. The toothbrush is not worn out and will function effectively. The toothbrush is assigned to you and not someone else. 

1. Locate the toothbrush and toothpaste visually. Take note of this location.
2. Take and hold the toothpaste with your left hand. 
3. Take and hold the toothbrush with your right hand.
4. While still holding the toothbrush in your right hand, use the thumb and index finger of your right hand, to unscrew the cap of the toothpaste in your left hand, counter-clockwise.
5. Hold the mouth of the toothpaste to the top of the toothbrush bristles.
6. Gently squeeze the toothpaste with your left hand until an appropriate amount of toothpaste has been applied to the toothbrush bristles. An appropriate amount is between as small as a pea and full coverage of the bristles.
7. Move away the toothpaste container from the toothbrush and continue to close it; screw back the toothpaste cap from step 4 in a clockwise manner.
8. Put the toothpaste container back to where you found it. 
9. You should now only be holding the toothbrush with toothpaste applied in your right hand.
10. _Optional: Bring the toothbrush to just below the faucet, with its bristles upwards. Turn on the faucet lightly for 1-2 seconds. Turn off the faucet._
12. Bring the toothbrush inside your mouth and begin to brush your teeth: In a pattern of your preference, brush the toothbrush firmly against the tooth for 2-4 seconds on the front, back and top of the tooth. The bottom of the tooth is (typically) not accessible and should not be brushed. Do this for all the teeth within your mouth.
13. _Optional: If the toothbrush has a scraper on the back of it, this can be used to clean the top of your tongue, like you would a tooth._
14. When finished, remove the toothbrush from your mouth.
15. By now you should have foam formed in your mouth by the toothpaste. This should be spat out into the sink. 
16. Perform step 10. Optionally, rinse your mouth with water. The water can be gargled for style points. (Remember to spit out the water, if any)
17. Put the toothbrush back to where you found it.

Hands and item location (within hands) can be changed to your preference. You can put down the toothpaste cap on the sink during step 2-6 but you must remember to pick it up from the sink before step 7.

## Part 2 - TDD
> _Complete the following two katas using TDD._

### 2.1 - Fahrenheit To Celsius Converter (and vice versa)
See src folder.

#### Test results
Test results can be found in [Test Results - TemperatureConverterTest.html](Test%20Results%20-%20TemperatureConverterTest.html).

### 2.2 Arabic Numeral to Roman Numeral Converter
See src folder

#### Test results
Test results can be found in [Test Results - RomanConverterTest.html](Test%20Results%20-%20RomanConverterTest.html)

## Part 3 - Reflections
What was positive and good about using TDD?  
- It felt good to use again after the initial hurdles getting back into it.
- I refactored automatically.
- It made me think about most, if not all, of the possible outcomes of the code.

What was annoying or difficult?  
- I had to refactor a few times.
- Had not setup Junit 5 in IntelliJ before. Took some time.

What surprised you?  
- The second TDD, the roman to arabic converter, was way easier once I had finished the process once in the temperature converter. This may be because it has been some time since I last used TDD.

Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldnâ€™t otherwise have thought of?  
- Maybe. Don't think so - I either write tests fully comitted or not at all.
